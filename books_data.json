People think that when you want to change your life  you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day  waking up five minutes early  or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book  Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking  the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule  or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone)  and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way  he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists  leading CEOs  and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive  motivated  and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career  your relationships  and your life. ________________________________ A NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'A supremely practical and useful book.'

From Greta Thunberg  the world's leading climate activist  comes the essential handbook for making it happen. You might think it's an impossible task: secure a safe future for life on Earth  at a scale and speed never seen  against all the odds. There is hope - but only if we listen to the science before it's too late. In The Climate Book  Greta Thunberg has gathered the wisdom of over one hundred experts - geophysicists  oceanographers and meteorologists; engineers  economists and mathematicians; historians  philosophers and indigenous leaders - to equip us all with the knowledge we need to combat climate disaster. Alongside them  she shares her own stories of demonstrating and uncovering greenwashing around the world  revealing how much we have been kept in the dark. This is one of our biggest challenges  she shows  but also our greatest source of hope. Once we are given the full picture  how can we not act? And if a schoolchild's strike could ignite a global protest  what could we do collectively if we tried? We are alive at the most decisive time in the history of humanity. Together  we can do the seemingly impossible. But it has to be us  and it has to be now. ",

Ryle is assertive  stubborn  maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive  brilliant  and has a total soft spot for Lily  but Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his 'no dating' rule  she can't help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her  so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan - her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit  her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears  everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel  It Ends With Us is a heart-wrenching story and an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price. ",

        "description": " THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour  starting now. People think that when you want to change your life  you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day  waking up five minutes early  or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book  Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking  the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule  or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone)  and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way  he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists  leading CEOs  and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive  motivated  and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career  your relationships  and your life. ________________________________ A NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'A supremely practical and useful book.'

More importantly  who would you want to meet  maybe for one last time? In a small back alley in Tokyo  there is a cafe which has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. But this coffee shop offers its customers a unique experience: the chance to travel back in time. In Before the Coffee Gets Cold  we meet four visitors  each of whom is hoping to make use of the cafe's time-travelling offer  in order to: confront the man who left them  receive a letter from their husband whose memory has been taken by early onset Alzheimer's  see their sister one last time  and meet the daughter they never got the chance to know. But the journey into the past does not come without risks: customers must sit in a particular seat  they cannot leave the cafe  and finally  they must return to the present before the coffee gets cold . . .

From Greta Thunberg  the world's leading climate activist  comes the essential handbook for making it happen. You might think it's an impossible task: secure a safe future for life on Earth  at a scale and speed never seen  against all the odds. There is hope - but only if we listen to the science before it's too late. In The Climate Book  Greta Thunberg has gathered the wisdom of over one hundred experts - geophysicists  oceanographers and meteorologists; engineers  economists and mathematicians; historians  philosophers and indigenous leaders - to equip us all with the knowledge we need to combat climate disaster. Alongside them  she shares her own stories of demonstrating and uncovering greenwashing around the world  revealing how much we have been kept in the dark. This is one of our biggest challenges  she shows  but also our greatest source of hope. Once we are given the full picture  how can we not act? And if a schoolchild's strike could ignite a global protest  what could we do collectively if we tried? We are alive at the most decisive time in the history of humanity. Together  we can do the seemingly impossible. But it has to be us  and it has to be now. ",

        "description": " 'A brilliant  very funny  very revealing autobiography-through-music. Maybe the best book ever written about being a rockstar' CAITLIN MORAN _______________________________________________________________ Bono - artist  activist and the lead singer of Irish rock band U2 - has written his autobiography: honest and irreverent  intimate and profound  Surrender is the story of the remarkable life he's lived  the challenges he's faced and the friends and family who have shaped and sustained him. 'When I started to write this book I was hoping to draw in detail what I'd previously only sketched in songs. The people  places  and possibilities in my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking)  it was not a natural concept. A word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for the book. I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band  in my marriage  in my faith  in my life as an activist. Surrender is the story of one pilgrim's lack of progress ... With a fair amount of fun along the way.' - Bono As one of the music world's most iconic artists and the cofounder of organizations ONE and (RED)  Bono's career has been written about extensively. But in Surrender  Bono's autobiography  he picks up the pen  writing for the first time about his remarkable life and those he has shared it with. In his unique voice  Bono takes us from his early days growing up in Dublin  including the sudden loss of his mother when he was 14  to U2's unlikely journey to become one of the world's most influential rock bands  to his more than 20 years of activism dedicated to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. Writing with candour  self-reflection  and humour  Bono opens the aperture on his life - and the family  friends and faith that have sustained  challenged and shaped him. Surrender's subtitle  \"40 Songs  One Story \" is a nod to the book's 40 chapters  which are each named after a U2 song. Bono has also created 40 original drawings for Surrender which will appear throughout the book. ",

When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British Empire? When will Facebook contain more profiles of dead people than living? How many humans would a T Rex rampaging through New York need to eat a day? In pursuit of answers  Munroe runs computer simulations  pores over stacks of declassified military research memos  solves differential equations and consults nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity  complemented by comics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind  or at least a really big explosion. ",

A historical fantasy epic about a tyrant's second chance at life and the powerful cultivation teacher he can't get out of his mind. Massacring his way to the top to become emperor of the cultivation world  Mo Ran's cruel reign left him with little satisfaction. Now  upon suffering his greatest loss  he takes his own life... To his surprise  Mo Ran awakens in his own body at age sixteen  years before he ever began his bloody conquests. Now  as a novice disciple at the cultivation sect known as Sisheng Peak  Mo Ran has a second chance at life. This time  he vows that he will attain the gratification that eluded him in his last life: the overly righteous shall fall  and none will dare treat him like a dog ever again! His furious passion burns most fiercely for his shizun  Chu Wanning  the beautiful yet cold cultivation teacher who maintains a cat-like aloofness in his presence. Yet despite Mo Ran's shameless pursuit of his own goals  he begins to question his previously held beliefs  and wonders if there could be more to his teacher-and his own feelings-than he ever realized. This Chinese fantasy (xianxia) epic built around the desire between two men (danmei) has been translated into multiple languages and inspired a multimedia franchise in China. The Seven Seas English-language edition will include exclusive  all-new covers and interior illustrations from artist St with a translation by Rynn & Jun. ",

But what if you realised that you weren't just lying about the little things  but the big 'life' stuff too? When Toni Lodge sat down to write this memoir  she realised that the lies she was telling herself were hiding some pretty important home truths-about her work  her identity and her mental health. Her dogged pursuit of these truths sent her on a brazen exploration of everything from gastro  fame and Twilight to funerals  the Dalai Lama and Brazilian waxes. In this hilarious warm hug of a book  Toni exposes the lies she has told herself about who she is and what she is capable of  inviting us on a riotous romp that will make you laugh  cringe  cry and utterly rethink the truth behind the stories we tell ourselves.

        "description": " Who are you? When you start to explore this question  you find out how elusive it really is. Are you a physical body? A collection of experiences and memories? A partner to relationships? Each time you consider aspects of yourself  you realize that there is much more to you than any of these can define. In this book  spiritual teacher Michael Singer explores the question of who we are and arrives at the conclusion that our identity is to be found in our consciousness  the fact of our ability to observe ourselves and the world around us. By tapping into traditions of meditation and mindfulness  Singer shows how the development of consciousness can enable us all to dwell in the present moment and let go of painful thoughts and memories that keep us from achieving happiness and self-realization. Divided into five parts  the book offers a frank and friendly discussion of consciousness and how we can develop it. In part one  he examines the notion of self and the inner dialogue that all of us live with. Part two examines the experience of energy as it flows through us and works to show readers how to open their hearts to the energy of experience that permeates their lives. Ways to overcome tendencies to close down to the rest of the world are the subject of part three. Enlightenment and the embrace of universal consciousness are the subject of part four. And finally  in part five  Singer returns to daily life and the pursuit of \"unconditional happiness.\" Throughout  the book maintains a light and engaging tone  free from heavy dogma and prescriptive religious references. The easy exercises that figure in each chapter help readers experience the ideas that Singer presents. ",

A masterpiece of empowerment - this book changed my life and  trust me  it'll change yours too.' MEL ROBBINS  author of The 5 Second Rule As a clinical psychologist  Dr Nicole LePera found herself frustrated by the limitations of traditional psychotherapy. Wanting more for her patients - and for herself - she began a journey to develop a united philosophy of mental  physical and spiritual health that equips people with the tools necessary to heal themselves. After experiencing the life-changing results herself  she began to share what she'd learned with others - and The Holistic Psychologist was born. Now Dr LePera is ready to share her much-requested protocol with the world. In How to Do the Work  she offers both a manifesto for self-healing and an essential guide to creating a more vibrant  authentic  and joyful life. Drawing on the latest research from both scientific research and healing modalities  Dr LePera helps us recognise how adverse experiences and trauma in childhood live with us  keeping us stuck engaging in patterns of codependency  emotional immaturity  and trauma bonds. Unless addressed  these self-sabotaging behaviours can quickly become cyclical  leaving people feeling unhappy  unfulfilled  and unwell. In How to Do the Work  Dr LePera offers readers the support and tools that will allow them to break free from destructive behaviours to reclaim and recreate their lives. Nothing short of a paradigm shift  this is a celebration of empowerment that will forever change the way we approach mental wellness and self-care. ",

        "description": " THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AND SUNDAY TIMES  OBSERVER AND BBC HISTORY BOOK OF THE YEAR FINALIST FOR THE ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL WRITING 2022 'Pacey and potentially revolutionary' Sunday Times 'Iconoclastic and irreverent ... an exhilarating read' The Guardian For generations  our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike - either free and equal  or thuggish and warlike. Civilization  we are told  could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or  alternatively  by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a reaction to indigenous critiques of European society  and why they are wrong. In doing so  they overturn our view of human history  including the origins of farming  property  cities  democracy  slavery and civilization itself. Drawing on path-breaking research in archaeology and anthropology  the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we begin to see what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 per cent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers  what were they doing all that time? If agriculture  and cities  did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination  then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected  and suggest that the course of history may be less set in stone  and more full of playful possibilities than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom  new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range  animated by curiosity  moral vision and faith in the power of direct action. 'This is not a book.

        "description": " 'There's never been a more honest or raw memoir ... and it may just save lives' Daily Mail 'Funny  fascinating  compelling ... also a wonderful read for fans of Friends' The Times The beloved star of Friends takes us behind the scenes of the hit sitcom and his struggles with addiction in this candid  funny  and revelatory memoir that delivers a powerful message of hope and persistence. 'Hi  my name is Matthew  although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty. And I should be dead.' So begins the riveting story of acclaimed actor Matthew Perry  taking us along on his journey from childhood ambition to fame to addiction and recovery in the aftermath of a life-threatening health scare. Before the frequent hospital visits and stints in rehab  there was five-year-old Matthew  who travelled from Montreal to Los Angeles  shuffling between his separated parents; fourteen-year-old Matthew  who was a nationally ranked tennis star in Canada; twenty-four-year-old Matthew  who nabbed a coveted role as a lead cast member on the talked-about pilot then called Friends Like Us. . . and so much more. In an extraordinary story that only he could tell - and in the heartfelt  hilarious  and warmly familiar way only he could tell it - Matthew Perry lays bare the fractured family that raised him (and also left him to his own devices)  the desire for recognition that drove him to fame  and the void inside him that could not be filled even by his greatest dreams coming true. But he also details the peace he's found in sobriety and how he feels about the ubiquity of Friends  sharing stories about his castmates and other stars he met along the way. Frank  self-aware  and with his trademark humour  Perry vividly depicts his lifelong battle with addiction and what fuelled it despite seemingly having it all. Friends  Lovers  and the Big Terrible Thing is an unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-opening - as well as a hand extended to anyone struggling with sobriety. Unflinchingly honest  moving  and uproariously funny  this is the book fans have been waiting for. 'An unflinching and often harrowing must-read for 90s pop culture fans' Guardian 'Written with Chandler's trademark sarcasm and self-deprecation' Telegraph 'A hopeful read ... I started to think of [it] not as a celebrity memoir about addiction  but as an addiction memoir written by a man who understands his own history through the prism of showbiz' Independent ",

Here  at her most provocative and intensely personal  the renowned scholar  cultural critic  and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question \"What is love?\" her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters  hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society's failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire  she provides a new path to love that is sacred  redemptive  and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the \"100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.\" All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can. ",

'Contemporary romance's unicorn: the elusive marriage of deeply brainy and delightfully escapist.' Christina Lauren  New York Times bestselling author of The Unhoneymooners * When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction  it throws one woman's carefully calculated theories on love into chaos. As a third-year Ph.D. candidate  Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships but her best friend does  and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive on her way to a happily ever after was always going to be tough  scientists require proof. So  like any self-respecting woman  Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen  a young hotshot professor and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when he agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire and Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support (and his unyielding abs)  their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. Olive soon discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope. What the five star reviews are saying about The Love Hypothesis: 'Did I read this in 24 hours? Yes.' 'Funny. Snarky. Intelligent. Real.' 'If you're even slightly thinking about getting this book to read  just go a head and do it' 'Adam is just *swoon*' 'Ali Hazelwood has made herself an auto-buy author' 'It was just... perfect.'

If you want a brief but thorough education in numeric thinking about many of the fundamental forces that shape human life  this is the book to read. It's a tour de force' BILL GATES __________ We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don't know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production  through our material world and its globalization  to risks  our environment and its future  How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check - because before we can tackle problems effectively  we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought-provoking book we see  for example  that globalization isn't inevitable and that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels  making their complete and rapid elimination unlikely. Drawing on the latest science and tackling sources of misinformation head on - from Yuval Noah Harari to Noam Chomsky - ultimately Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? __________ 'Very informative and eye-opening in many ways' HA-JOON CHANG  author of 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism 'If you are anxious about the future  and infuriated that we aren't doing enough about it  please read this book' PAUL COLLIER  author of The Future of Capitalism ",

        "description": " SHORTLISTED FOR THE WOMEN'S PRIZE 2022 A REESE WITHERSPOON BOOK CLUB PICK SHORTLISTED FOR THE COSTA NOVEL AWARD 2021 A rich  magical novel from the Booker-shortlisted author of 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World - now a top ten Sunday Times bestseller It is 1974 on the island of Cyprus. Two teenagers  from opposite sides of a divided land  meet at a tavern in the city they both call home. The tavern is the only place that Kostas  who is Greek and Christian  and Defne  who is Turkish and Muslim  can meet  in secret  hidden beneath the blackened beams from which hang garlands of garlic  chilli peppers and wild herbs. This is where one can find the best food in town  the best music  the best wine. But there is something else to the place: it makes one forget  even if for just a few hours  the world outside and its immoderate sorrows. In the centre of the tavern  growing through a cavity in the roof  is a fig tree. This tree will witness their hushed  happy meetings  their silent  surreptitious departures; and the tree will be there when the war breaks out  when the capital is reduced to rubble  when the teenagers vanish and break apart. Decades later in north London  sixteen-year-old Ada Kazantzakis has never visited the island where her parents were born. Desperate for answers  she seeks to untangle years of secrets  separation and silence. The only connection she has to the land of her ancestors is a Ficus Carica growing in the back garden of their home. The Island of Missing Trees is a rich  magical tale of belonging and identity  love and trauma  nature  and  finally  renewal. 'This book moved me to tears . . . in the best way. Powerful and poignant' Reese Witherspoon 'A brilliant novel -- one that rings with Shafak's characteristic compassion' Robert Macfarlane 'This is an enchanting  compassionate and wise novel and storytelling at its most sublime' Polly Samson ",

In Breath  journalist James Nestor travels the world to discover the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.

        "description": " Many modern knowledge workers now spend most of their brain power battling distraction and interruption  whether because of the incessant pinging of devices  noisy open-plan offices or the difficulty of deciding what deserves your attention the most. When Cal Newport coined the term 'deep work' on his popular blog  Study Hacks  in 2012  he found the concept quickly hit a nerve. Most of us  after all  are excruciatingly familiar with shallow work instead - distractedly skimming the surface of our workload and never getting to the important part. Newport began exploring the methods and mindset that foster a practice of distraction-free productivity at work  and now  in DEEP WORK  he shows how anyone can achieve this elusive state. Through revealing portraits of both historical and modern-day thinkers  academics and leaders in the fields of technology  science and culture  and their deep work habits  Newport shares an inspiring collection of tools to wring every last drop of value out of your intellectual capacity. He explains why mastering this shift in work practices is crucial for anyone who intends to stay ahead in a complex information economy  and how to systematically train the mind to focus. Put simply: developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions we can make in an increasingly distracted world. ",

        "title": "Born A Crime : Stories from a South African Childhood",
        "description": " WINNER OF THE THURBER PRIZE The compelling  inspiring  (often comic) coming-of-age story of Trevor Noah  set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. One of the comedy world's brightest new voices  Trevor Noah is a light-footed but sharp-minded observer of the absurdities of politics  race and identity  sharing jokes and insights drawn from the wealth of experience acquired in his relatively young life. As host of the US hit show The Daily Show with Trevor Noah  he provides viewers around the globe with their nightly dose of biting satire  but here Noah turns his focus inward  giving readers a deeply personal  heartfelt and humorous look at the world that shaped him. Noah was born a crime  son of a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother  at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion  Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the first years of his life  bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could  at any moment  take him away. A collection of eighteen personal stories  Born a Crime tells the story of a mischievous young boy growing into a restless young man as he struggles to find his place in a world where he was never supposed to exist. Born a Crime is equally the story of that young man's fearless  rebellious and fervently religious mother - a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty  violence and abuse that ultimately threatens her own life. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times  being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping  or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school  Noah illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and an unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a personal portrait of an unlikely childhood in a dangerous time  as moving and unforgettable as the very best memoirs and as funny as Noah's own hilarious stand-up. Born a Crime is a must read. ",

When the Emperor transfers stewardship of Arrakis from the noble House Harkonnen to House Atreides  the Harkonnens fight back  murdering Duke Leto Atreides. Paul  his son  and Lady Jessica  his concubine  flee into the desert. On the point of death  they are rescued by a band for Fremen  the native people of Arrakis  who control Arrakis' second great resource: the giant worms that burrow beneath the burning desert sands. In order to avenge his father and retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens  Paul must earn the trust of the Fremen and lead a tiny army against the innumerable forces aligned against them.

Law 1: Never outshine the master Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends; learn how to use enemies Law 3: Conceal your intentions Law 4: Always say less than necessary. The text is bold and elegant  laid out in black and red throughout and replete with fables and unique word sculptures. The 48 laws are illustrated through the tactics  triumphs and failures of great figures from the past who have wielded - or been victimised by - power. ___________________________________ (From the Playboy interview with Jay-Z  April 2003) PLAYBOY: Rap careers are usually over fast: one or two hits  then styles change and a new guy comes along. Why have you endured while other rappers haven't? JAY-Z: I would say that it's from still being able to relate to people. It's natural to lose yourself when you have success  to start surrounding yourself with fake people. In The 48 Laws of Power  it says the worst thing you can do is build a fortress around yourself. I still got the people who grew up with me  my cousin and my childhood friends.

        "description": " Are you one of the countless people who grew up with emotionally immature parents? If you suffer from this troubling parent/child dynamic  you may still recall painful moments from your childhood when your emotional needs were not met  when your feelings were dismissed  or when you took on adult levels of maturity in an effort to \"compensate\" for your parents' behavior. And while you likely cultivated strengths such as self-reliance and independence along the way- strengths that have served you well as an adult-having to be the emotionally mature person in your relationship with your parent is confusing and even damaging. If you are ready to gain the insight you need to move on from feelings of loneliness and abandonment and find healthy ways to meet your own emotional needs  this book will help light the way. You'll discover the four main types of emotionally immature parents: *Emotional parents  who may vacillate between over-involvement and abandonment  leading to frightening instability and unpredictability *Driven parents  who are often compulsively busy and can't stop trying to perfect everything  including other people *Passive parents  who may have a laissez-faire mindset and avoid dealing with anything upsetting *Rejecting parents  who may withdraw from any relationship with their child  showing either detachment or anger as primary responses All emotionally immature parents have one defining characteristic in common  even if they differ in style-none of them puts their child's needs first. This book will show you that you are not to blame for your parent's behavior. It also offers real skills for handling difficult family situations and moving on from the emotional wounds of your childhood. If you are ready to gain a greater understanding of both your parents and yourself  this book provides a much-needed guide. ",

        "title": "Meditations : A New Translation",
        "description": " Nearly two thousand years after it was written  Meditations remains profoundly relevant for anyone seeking to lead a meaningful life. Few ancient works have been as influential as the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius  philosopher and emperor of Rome (A.D. 161-180). A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom  practical guidance  and profound understanding of human behavior  it remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. Marcus's insights and advice--on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others--have made the Meditations required reading for statesmen and philosophers alike  while generations of ordinary readers have responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. For anyone who struggles to reconcile the demands of leadership with a concern for personal integrity and spiritual well-being  the Meditations remains as relevant now as it was two thousand years ago. In Gregory Hays's new translation--the first in thirty-five years--Marcus's thoughts speak with a new immediacy. In fresh and unencumbered English  Hays vividly conveys the spareness and compression of the original Greek text. Never before have Marcus's insights been so directly and powerfully presented. With an Introduction that outlines Marcus's life and career  the essentials of Stoic doctrine  the style and construction of the Meditations  and the work's ongoing influence  this edition makes it possible to fully rediscover the thoughts of one of the most enlightened and intelligent leaders of any era.

        "description": " Considered by many the greatest war novel of all time  All Quiet on the Western Front is Erich Maria Remarque's masterpiece of the German experience during World War I. I am young  I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair  death  fear  and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. . . . This is the testament of Paul B\u00e4umer  who enlists with his classmates in the German army during World War I. They become soldiers with youthful enthusiasm. But the world of duty  culture  and progress they had been taught breaks in pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. Through years of vivid horror  Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive. \"The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank  a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature  his touch is sensitive  firm  and sure.\"--The New York Times Book Review ",

        "title": "Rich Dad Poor Dad : What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!",
        "description": " April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published  readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed - and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed  the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad haven't changed. Today  as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives  the messages in Robert Kiyosaki's international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever. Milestones While there is a milestone to commemorate - and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important - preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again  but the core principles that parents and grandparents - those who embraced Robert's story and messages 25 years ago - are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone's life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances. People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time  mark progress  reflect on the lessons we've learned  and celebrate accomplishments... and they give meaning to our life's journey. They are a way that we integrate past  present  and future... looking back at where we started  where we are today... and the promise of all that the future can hold. In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published - 25 years since April 8  1997 - so many things in our world have changed. But the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives  like it or not  and technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money. In an ever-changing world  we can all still get smarter when it comes to money... and learn as much as we can to secure our future. Still the One... #1 Today Rich Dad Poor Dad consistently ranks among bestsellers around the world in the categories of Personal Finance  Parenting  and Investing  has been translated into 38 languages  and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads - his real father and the father of his best friend  his rich dad - and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you. In many ways  the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad  messages that were challenged and criticized 25 ago  are more meaningful  relevant  and important today than ever. Rich Dad Poor Dad... * Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich * Challenges the belief that your house is an asset * Shows parents why they can't rely on the school system to teach their kids about money * Defines once and for all an asset and a liability * Teaches you what to teach your kids about money for their future financial success ",

Peterson offered an antidote to the chaos in our lives: eternal truths applied to modern anxieties. His insights have helped millions of readers and resonated powerfully around the world. Now in this long-awaited sequel  Peterson goes further  showing that part of life's meaning comes from reaching out into the domain beyond what we know  and adapting to an ever-transforming world. While an excess of chaos threatens us with uncertainty  an excess of order leads to a lack of curiosity and creative vitality. Beyond Order therefore calls on us to balance the two fundamental principles of reality - order and chaos - and reveals the profound meaning that can be found on the path that divides them. In times of instability and suffering  Peterson reminds us that there are sources of strength on which we can all draw: insights borrowed from psychology  philosophy  and humanity's greatest myths and stories. Drawing on the hard-won truths of ancient wisdom  as well as deeply personal lessons from his own life and clinical practice  Peterson offers twelve new principles to guide readers towards a more courageous  truthful and meaningful life.

        "description": " Translated by Constance Garnett with an Introduction and Notes by Dr Keith Carabine  University of Kent at Canterbury. Crime and Punishment is one of the greatest and most readable novels ever written. From the beginning we are locked into the frenzied consciousness of Raskolnikov who  against his better instincts  is inexorably drawn to commit a brutal double murder. From that moment on  we share his conflicting feelings of self-loathing and pride  of contempt for and need of others  and of terrible despair and hope of redemption: and  in a remarkable transformation of the detective novel  we follow his agonised efforts to probe and confront both his own motives for  and the consequences of  his crime. The result is a tragic novel built out of a series of supremely dramatic scenes that illuminate the eternal conflicts at the heart of human existence: most especially our desire for self-expression and self-fulfilment  as against the constraints of morality and human laws; and our agonised awareness of the world's harsh injustices and of our own mortality  as against the mysteries of divine justice and immortality.

Seriously. Bunny. Samantha Heather Mackey is an outsider in her small  highly selective MFA program at Warren University. In fact  she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort - a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other 'Bunny'. But then the Bunnies issue her with an invitation and Samantha finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door  across the threshold  and down their rabbit hole.

        "description": " 'A hymn of love to the world ... A journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific  as sacred as it is historical  as clever as it is wise' Elizabeth Gilbert  author of Eat  Pray  Love As a botanist  Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation  she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass  Kimmerer brings these two ways of knowledge together. Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist  a mother  and a woman  Kimmerer shows how other living beings - asters and goldenrod  strawberries and squash  salamanders  algae  and sweetgrass - offer us gifts and lessons  even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In a rich braid of reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today  she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth  and learn to give our own gifts in return. ",

James Clear  one of the world's leading experts on habit formation  reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits  break bad ones  and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits  the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change  but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here  you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here  he draws on the most proven ideas from biology  psychology  and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way  readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists  award-winning artists  business leaders  life-saving physicians  and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: - make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); - overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; - design your environment to make success easier; - get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success  and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship  an organization hoping to redefine an industry  or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking  lose weight  reduce stress  or achieve any other goal.

The Bell Jar is one of the defining novels of the 20th century. I was supposed to be having the time of my life . . . Working as an intern for a New York fashion magazine in the summer of 1953  Esther Greenwood is on the brink of her future. Yet she is also on the edge of a darkness that makes her world increasingly unreal. Esther's vision of the world shimmers and shifts: day-to-day living in the sultry city  her crazed men-friends  the hot dinner dances . . . The Bell Jar  Sylvia Plath's only novel  is partially based on Plath's own life. It has been celebrated for its darkly funny and razor sharp portrait of 1950s society  and has sold millions of copies worldwide.

Our lives are driven by a fact that most of us can't name and don't understand. It defines who our friends and lovers are  which careers we choose  and whether we blush when we're embarrassed. That fact is whether we're an introvert or an extrovert. The most fundamental dimension of personality  at least a third of us are introverts  and yet shyness  sensitivity and seriousness are often seen as a negative. Some of the world's most talented people are introverts - without them we wouldn't have the Apple computer  the theory of relativity and Van Gogh's sunflowers. In Quiet  Susan Cain shows how society misunderstands and undervalues introverts while giving them the tools to better understand themselves and take full advantage of their strengths. Passionately argued  superbly researched  and filled with real stories  whether an introvert or extrovert  this book will change how you see human beings for good. ***** 'I can't get Quiet out of my head.

When a pair of detectives from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation arrive  they meet expected resistance from the local sheriff  his deputy  the coroner  and a string of racist White townsfolk. The murders present a puzzle  for at each crime scene there is a second dead body - that of a man who resembles Emmett Till  a young black boy lynched in the same town 65 years before. The detectives suspect that these are killings of retribution  but soon discover that eerily similar murders are taking place all over the country. Something truly strange is afoot. As the bodies pile up  the MBI detectives seek answers from a local root doctor who has been documenting every lynching in the country for years  uncovering a history that refuses to be buried. In this bold  provocative book  Everett takes direct aim at racism and police violence  and does so in a fast-paced style that ensures the reader can't look away. The Trees is an enormously powerful novel of lasting importance. ",

        "title": "The Fall of Numenor : And Other Tales from the Second Age of Middle-Earth",
        "description": " J.R.R. Tolkien's writings on the Second Age of Middle-earth  collected for the first time in one volume. J.R.R. Tolkien famously described the Second Age of Middle-earth as a 'dark age  and not very much of its history is (or need be) told'. And for many years readers would need to be content with the tantalizing glimpses of it found within the pages of The Lord of the Rings and its appendices  including the forging of the Rings of Power  the building of the Barad-dur and the rise of Sauron. It was not until Christopher Tolkien published The Silmarillion after his father's death that a fuller story could be told. Although much of the book's content concerned the First Age of Middle-earth  there were at its close two key works that revealed the tumultuous events concerning the rise and fall of the island of Numenor. Raised out of the Great Sea and gifted to the Men of Middle-earth as a reward for aiding the angelic Valar and the Elves in the defeat and capture of the Dark Lord Morgoth  the kingdom became a seat of influence and wealth; but as the Numenoreans' power increased  the seed of their downfall would inevitably be sown  culminating in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Even greater insight into the Second Age would be revealed in subsequent publications  first in Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth  then expanded upon in Christopher Tolkien's magisterial twelve-volume The History of Middle-earth  in which he presented and discussed a wealth of further tales written by his father  many in draft form. Now  adhering to the timeline of 'The Tale of Years' in the appendices to The Lord of the Rings  editor Brian Sibley has assembled into one comprehensive volume a new chronicle of the Second Age of Middle-earth  told substantially in the words of J.R.R. Tolkien from the various published texts  with new illustrations in watercolour and pencil by the doyen of Tolkien art  Alan Lee. ",

This is the framework for meaningful connection.\" In Atlas of the Heart  Brown takes us on a journey through 87 of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and lays out an actionable framework for meaningful connection  she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances - a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heart-breaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection. Over the past two decades  Brown's extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research  as well as Brown's singular skills as a researcher/storyteller  to lay out an invaluable  research-based framework that shows us that naming an experience doesn't give the experience more power  it gives us the power of understanding  meaning and choice. Brown shares  \"I want this to be an atlas for all of us  because I believe that  with an adventurous heart and the right maps  we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves. Even when we have no idea where we are.\" ",

        "title": "No Bad Parts : Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness with the Internal Family Systems Model",
        "description": " Is there some part of yourself that you wish would go away? Most of us would say yes  whether we call it addiction  the inner critic  \"monkey mind \" neurosis  sinfulness  bad habits  or some other disparaging name. Yet what if there were a different way to approach these aspects of yourself that leads to true healing instead of constant inner struggle? With No Bad Parts  Dr. Richard Schwartz teaches a revolutionary paradigm of understanding and relating with ourselves - a method that brings us into inner harmony  enhances self-compassion  and opens the doors to spiritual awakening. Dr. Schwartz is the creator of Internal Family Systems (IFS)  a paradigm-changing model of consciousness that has been transforming psychology for decades. Here  you'll learn why IFS has been so effective in areas such as trauma recovery  addiction therapy  depression  and more. IFS overturns the idea that we have one \"true\" identity and recognizes that having multiple parts is not a pathology  but a normal and healthy function of the human mind. Dr. Schwartz shares insights and practices to help you recognise your own \"inner family\" of parts  understand how each part seeks to help and protect you even when it seems problematic  engage in inner dialogue to restore balance and self-love - and deepen your awareness of the higher Self that holds and encompasses every facet of your diverse consciousness.

        "title": "Noma 2.0",
        "description": " There's a reason Noma sits atop the list of the world's best restaurants. Every bite  every dish  every course surprises  delights  challenges  and deeply satisfies in a way that's unique in the world of dining. As the New York Times's Pete Wells wrote recently in praising Noma's flavors  \"sauces are administered so subtly that you don't notice anything weird going on; you just think you've never tasted anything so extraordinary in your life.\" In Noma 2.0  Rene Redzepi digs deep into the restaurant's magic through the creation of nearly 200 dishes  each photographed in spectacular beauty and detail. Noma 2.0--the title is a reference to the reinvention of Noma after it closed in 2018 to move to its new compound across the water--is about true seasonality  from wild game in the fall to just-picked peas in the summer. It is about using only local ingredients  to build a cuisine that is profoundly situated in its place and culture. It is about transforming the ordinary--a mushroom  a chicken wing  often through fermentation--to develop haunting  memorable flavors. It is about composing a plate that delights the eye as much as the palate  whether through the trompe l'oeil of a \"flowerpot\" chocolate cake or a dazzling mandala of flowers and berries. It is about pushing the boundaries of what we think we want to eat--a baby pinecone  a pudding made of reindeer brain--to open our palates with a startling confidence. And it is about how to stay creative and challenge yourself over the course of a career. For foodies  for chefs  for artists and art lovers  for thought-leaders and makers  and for the kind of reader who is compelled by the idea that sometimes one person can change everything  Noma 2.0 is the gift book of the season.

It's an amazing tale' Bill Gates 'The best book I read last year was Shoe Dog  by Nike's Phil Knight. Phil is a very wise  intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller' Warren Buffett In 1962  fresh out of business school  Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality  low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the boot of his Plymouth  Knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today  Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of start-ups  Nike is the ne plus ultra of all start-ups  and the swoosh has become a revolutionary  globe-spanning icon  one of the most ubiquitous and recognisable symbols in the world today. But Knight  the man behind the swoosh  has always remained a mystery. Now  for the first time  he tells his story. Candid  humble  wry and gutsy  he begins with his crossroads moment when at 24 he decided to start his own business. He details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream - along with his early triumphs. Above all  he recalls how his first band of partners and employees soon became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together  harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission  and a deep belief in the spirit of sport  they built a brand that changed everything. A memoir rich with insight  humour and hard-won wisdom  this book is also studded with lessons - about building something from scratch  overcoming adversity  and ultimately leaving your mark on the world.

I loved it even more than The Love Hypothesis  and I didn't think that was possible' Cressida McLaughlin From the New York Times bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis comes a new STEMinist rom-com in which a scientist is forced to work on a project with her nemesis - with explosive results. Bee Koenigswasser lives by a simple code: What would Marie Curie do? If NASA offered her the lead on a neuroengineering project - a literal dream come true - Marie would accept without hesitation. Duh. But the mother of modern physics never had to co-lead with Levi Ward. Sure  Levi is attractive in a tall  dark  and piercing-eyes kind of way. But Levi made his feelings toward Bee very clear in grad school - archenemies work best employed in their own galaxies far  far away. But when her equipment starts to go missing and the staff ignore her  Bee could swear she sees Levi softening into an ally  backing her plays  seconding her ideas... devouring her with those eyes. The possibilities have all her neurons firing. But when it comes time to actually make a move and put her heart on the line  there's only one question that matters: What will Bee Koenigswasser do? 'Ali Hazelwood proves that science is sexy as hell  and that love can 'STEM' from the most unlikely places. She's my newest must-buy author.'

It will give you courage and hope.\"--Michael Thompson  Ph.D.  New York Times bestselling co-author of Raising Cain World-renowned authors Dr. Edward M. Hallowell and Dr. John J.

Their bestseller  Driven to Distraction  largely introduced this diagnosis to the public and sold more than a million copies along the way. Now  most people have heard of ADHD and know someone who may have it. But lost in the discussion of both childhood and adult diagnosis of ADHD is the potential upside: Many hugely successful entrepreneurs and highly creative people attribute their achievements to ADHD. Also unknown to most are the recent research developments  including innovations that give a clearer understanding of the ADHD brain in action. In ADHD 2.0  Drs. Hallowell and Ratey  both of whom have this \"variable attention trait \" draw on the latest science to provide both parents and adults with ADHD a plan for minimizing the downside and maximizing the benefits of ADHD at any age. They offer an arsenal of new strategies and lifestyle hacks for thriving with ADHD  including - Find the right kind of difficult. Use these behavior assessments to discover the work  activity  or creative outlet best suited to an individual's unique strengths. - Reimagine environment. What specific elements to look for--at home  at school  or in the workplace--to enhance the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the ADHD mind. - Embrace innate neurological tendencies. Take advantage of new findings about the brain's default mode network and cerebellum  which confer major benefits for people with ADHD. - Tap into the healing power of connection. Tips for establishing and maintaining positive connection \"the other Vitamind C\" and the best antidote to the negativity that plagues so many people with ADHD. - Consider medication. Gets the facts about the underlying chemistry  side effects  and proven benefits of all the pharmaceutical options. As inspiring as it is practical  ADHD 2.0 will help you tap into the power of this mercurial condition and find the key that unlocks potential. ",

We begin with the footsteps of a family walking along a beach 950 000 years ago. From here  Montefiore takes us on an exhilarating epic journey through the families that have shaped our world: the Caesars  Medicis and Incas  Ottomans and Mughals  Bonapartes  Habsburgs and Zulus  Rothschilds  Rockefellers and Krupps  Churchills  Kennedys  Castros  Nehrus  Pahlavis and Kenyattas  Saudis  Kims and Assads. A rich cast of complex characters form the beating heart of the story. Some are well-known leaders  from Alexander the Great  Attila  Ivan the Terrible and Genghis Khan to Hitler  Thatcher  Obama  Putin and Zelensky. Some are creative  from Socrates  Michelangelo and Shakespeare to Newton  Mozart  Balzac  Freud  Bowie and Tim Berners-Lee. Others are lesser-known: Hongwu  who began life as a beggar and founded the Ming dynasty; Kamehameha  conqueror of Hawaii; Zenobia  Arab empress who defied Rome; King Henry of Haiti; Lady Murasaki  first female novelist; Sayyida al-Hurra  Moroccan pirate-queen. Here are not just conquerors and queens but prophets  charlatans  actors  gangsters  artists  scientists  doctors  tycoons  lovers  wives  husbands and children. This is world history on the most grand and intimate scale - spanning centuries  continents and cultures  and linking grand themes of war  migration  plague  religion  medicine and technology to the people at the centre of the human drama. As spellbinding as fiction  The World captures the story of humankind in all its joy  sorrow  romance  ingenuity and cruelty in a ground-breaking  single narrative that will forever shift the boundaries of what history can achieve.

        "description": " 'Thrilling ... High-definition history: tight  thrilling and beautifully researched' SUNDAY TIMES 'This book is a triumph' DAN SNOW 9.07 a.m.  April 12  1961. A top-secret rocket site in the USSR. A young Russian sits inside a tiny capsule on top of the Soviet Union's most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile - originally designed to carry a nuclear warhead - and blasts into the skies. His name is Yuri Gagarin and he is about to make history. Travelling at almost 18 000 miles per hour - ten times faster than a rifle bullet - Gagarin circles the globe in just 106 minutes. While his launch begins in total secrecy  within hours of his landing he has become a world celebrity - the first human to leave the planet. Beyond tells the thrilling story behind that epic flight on its sixtieth anniversary. It happened at the height of the Cold War as the US and USSR confronted each other across an Iron Curtain. Both superpowers took enormous risks to get a man into space first - the Americans in the full glare of the media  the Soviets under deep cover. Both trained their teams of astronauts to the edges of the endurable. In the end the race between them would come down to the wire. Drawing on extensive original research and the vivid testimonies of eyewitnesses  many of whom have never spoken before  Stephen Walker unpacks secrets that were hidden for decades and takes the reader into the drama - featuring the scientists  engineers and political leaders on both sides  and above all the American astronauts and their Soviet rivals battling for supremacy in the heavens.
