Colleen Hoover tells fan favourite Atlas's side of the story and shares what comes next in this long-anticipated sequel to the #1 Sunday Times bestseller It Ends with Us Lily and her ex-husband  Ryle  have just settled into a civil co-parenting rhythm when she suddenly bumps into her first love  Atlas  again. After nearly two years separated  she is elated that for once  time is on their side  and she immediately says yes when Atlas asks her on a date. But her excitement is quickly hampered by the knowledge that  though they are no longer married  Ryle is still very much a part of her life-and Atlas Corrigan is the one man he will hate being in his ex-wife and daughter's life.
